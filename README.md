These problems are a part of my Master Thesis Project based on
"Security CTF Problems For Beginning Developers Of Low-Resource Real-Time Embedded Systems Software"
This reposity contains 5 "coherent" CTF challenges which revolve around a storyline.
TODO::Include link to thesis?
* Storyline: Please refer to Section 3 of thesis.

For each problem:
* Problem Statement: Refer to Section 4.< Problem Number >.2
* Hints: Please refer to Section 4.< Problem Number >.3

  To begin:
  * `cd EmbeddedSecurityCTFs/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/Demo/Posix_GCC/`
  * `make && build/posix_demo <Problem Number>`
  * For example, `make && build/posix_demo 1` will launch Problem 1 and so on.
 
ENJOY!
